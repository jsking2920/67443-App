# 67443-App
An iOS app created for 67-443 Mobile Application Development at CMU by Scott King, Shayan Panjwani, and Ahsan Rasool <br>

In order for app to function, you will need to get the GoogleService-Info.plist from Team 20's slack channel and put it in `/Songbird/Configs/`. You will also need to be added to the whitelist for our Spotify Web API app, which will require an email associated with a Spotify Premium Account (ping Scott on Slack in Team 20's channel). <br>
